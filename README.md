# automated-royalty-distribution-for-erc1155
  The contract herein can be applied as a royalty collections wallet on nft marketplaces and self manage automatic distribution of royalties to registered wallet addresses. This is an early version of the system which has initial success with distributing to multiple registered wallet addresses for erc1155 collections with a low number of token ids.
  On deploy set the collections contract address to be scanned on distribution, after public verification on chain users can manually register wallet addresses to be included for royalties collections on chain, feel free to create your own custom ui for interface.
  This is merely an early experimental version where an upgraded more complete system will include pre-register of a wallet address array that can be extracted from the blockchain via snapshot of contract address holders of any nft project that wishes to deploy the system.
  Tests have not been performed to handle a large number of wallet addresses, please feel free to experiment and provide feedback.

This repo is entirely open source for anybody to utilize and build upon.
